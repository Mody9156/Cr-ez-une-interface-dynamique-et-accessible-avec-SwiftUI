# Create a Dynamic and Accessible Interface

This project involves developing an iOS application using the skills acquired during the OpenClassrooms training. The application is built with Swift and SwiftUI, following the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern. The goal is to provide an intuitive user interface for interacting with an API and displaying the corresponding data.

- **Screenshot 1**: Display the article list screen where users can browse through the available articles.
  
- **Screenshot 2**: Show the article details screen, including descriptions, images, and relevant information about each article, once the user has selected an article.

- **Screenshot 3**: Present the article search screen, where users can input search criteria such as keywords, categories, and filters to find specific articles.

These can help illustrate the user flow and functionality visually.
